# Condo-Management
The project is for ICS4U1 Midterm.
It involves using C++ to build a management program for a condo with 10 floors and 10 units on each floor.
It can record and modify informations on the owners of each unit, as well as information on the unit itself.
The initial state of the program has no information on the units, and all the units are vacant.
